The ATM Console Application is a Java-based simulation of a basic Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. This project is designed to replicate real-world banking functionalities such as account balance checking, money deposit, withdrawals, and transaction history â€” all through a secure and interactive command-line interface.

Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, the application focuses on clean code structure, secure transaction handling, and user-friendly navigation. It serves as a practical learning project for understanding how backend banking systems operate and how user interactions can be managed effectively through Java.
